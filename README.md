# marvel countdown
DESCRIPTION: Multiple instances of a single JS countdown timer counting down to release dates of some of the upcoming Marvel movies


Some of the MCU Phase 4 release dates were pushed back by one slot, which reminded me to dig up and update this old little multiple-timer project.

So far this only has the titles "re-confirmed" dates, the ones that are still waiting for an official update will be updated later.

On a different note, this project is seriously lacking in any design & styling, so if any designers out there want to take a stab at it, feel free to contact me and we'll make it a collaboration :)
